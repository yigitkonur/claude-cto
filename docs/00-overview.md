# Overview

Welcome to the official documentation for **Claude Worker** v0.1.0, a flexible and robust fire-and-forget task execution system designed for the Claude Code SDK.

> **ðŸš€ Current Status:** Beta - Production-ready for individual developers and small teams. See our [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for upcoming enterprise features.

## What is Claude Worker?

Running long, complex tasks with the Claude Code SDK can be challenging. Your terminal is blocked, an interruption can lose hours of work, and managing multiple tasks is difficult. Claude Worker solves these problems by providing a persistent, scalable, and easy-to-integrate system.

### Core Features

*   **ðŸ”„ Fire-and-Forget Execution:** Submit a task and immediately get your terminal back. The server handles the execution in the background.
*   **ðŸ’¾ Persistent & Resilient:** Tasks are stored in a local SQLite database, so no work is lost even if the server restarts or crashes.
*   **ðŸ”’ Isolated & Scalable:** Each task runs in its own isolated process, preventing a single task failure from bringing down the entire system. Currently supports 4 concurrent workers (configurable in future releases).
*   **ðŸ”Œ Flexible Integration:** Three ways to interact with the system:
    - **CLI**: Human-friendly `claude-worker` command-line interface
    - **REST API**: Formal HTTP endpoints for custom integrations
    - **MCP Server**: Machine-friendly interface for AI agents with built-in guardrails

### Quick Example

```bash
# Start the server (runs in background)
claude-worker server start

# Submit a task and continue working
claude-worker run "Refactor the authentication module in ./src/auth" --watch

# Check all tasks anytime
claude-worker list
```
